==============================
Roll Call: Phil, Jeff, Thomas, Dmitriy, Andrew


Bylaws/Procedural Update

Membership Structure
  - Should we allow 1 time users? - 
  - Our financial sitch is "comfortable" 
  - 1 time sign-ups are net-zero gain for the space
  - Any onboarding changes to be made?
  - 1 day users - Disadvantages
    - liability is high
    - We're not staffed
    - We're "community-building"
    - We become more of a commodity - what do we do when a tool is broken
  - 1 month members might be a liability
  
  - Possible approach: "You have to engage with us at 2 public events"
    - Multiple visits are a bit of a burden
    - How to identify possible problem individuals?
      - Anyone can make that call
    - Two board member signatures are required to sign on
    - current info might imply that we are a "tech shop"
    - SSH:C is not a "tech shop"
    
 
  - How to emphasize preference for indefinite membership
  - Noob paradise

  - Big takeaway precedent - We do not endorse 1-day users.  Official response will be to tell interested 1-day Check at Make Chicago

  - Certification has no official ness - may need it's own workflow
  - Noob's paradise, 
    - ala PS1. 
    -  We get to know someone and its not a random event.
