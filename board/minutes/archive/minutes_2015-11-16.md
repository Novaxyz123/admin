Roll Call: Dmitriy, Phil, Ryan, Mason

President
- No buildout progress in last week
- Anticipating getting together with Tim week(end) of Thanksgiving to wire up the front room as much as we can
- Mudding to happen whenever people are available this month, 90 minute mud purchased (maybe 11/21?)
  - Sanding will be fun; Dmitriy tried the 20min mud at home and it actually worked pretty well
  - Hard part will be roundy parts
- Talked to Joe Budka about helping us make plans for plywood shelving and workbenches, but he has been too busy to contribute for now
- Stickers are here

Vice President

  - Needs a project box and some RCA and 3.5mm jacks

Chief Technology Officer
- Tech update: Microsoft licensing makes my head hurt. For the thing we're only allowed to do once, that's specifically for bringing non-compliant pirated Windows installs in spec. I need to go through the hundreds of different Windows licensing options on TechSoup and figure out which makes sense for us. :/
- Only need license on the Xeon tower that drives the lasercutter; everything else is up-to-date licenses or Linux
Other
- Phil, Andrew and Ryan did great service in making the back room less shitty this weekend
