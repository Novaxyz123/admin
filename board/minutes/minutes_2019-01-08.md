Potpourri
=========
 - Dmitriy got the fire extinguishers recertified - was a little more expensive because one of them had to get refilled (once per 5 years)
 - Dmitriy was griping about membership management and found new software - Tendenci
      - Supports stripe out of the box
      - Set up for giving discounts
      - Extensions/ability to write extensions to go to IDAP & etc.
      - Open source - may be able to get source code and see if it's worth it
      - At first glance, appears to be the best aligned to our values/goals
 - Spinoff active directory to login credentials - "corporate-style" option of making profiles for members on gaming PC rather than manually creating individual profiles
      - Our networking is bad - series of residential routers, may be good idea to "un-mess up" it
      - $1,000 in the bank, we could make our own LAN - Dmitriy may approach building ownership
      - Need to get monitors for gaming PC as well - this may be a general members issue
      - May need to get outside help for this
 - Party
