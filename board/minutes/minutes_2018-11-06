Jessica Fong's membership status - 
    - Was doing PR for membership
    - No longer doing PR
    - Voted to give her emeritus status, but no key
Empty positions to fill
    - PR, Member at large
    - People to ask:
         - Declan (Member at Large)
         - Eric Dominic (PR)
         - Christopher W (good fit but not much time)
Bylaws, etc.
    - Need bylaws developed regarding termination of membership
          - Need to make it explicit that board has discretion when terminating members violating rules
    - Need to address the lack of participation in voting/board
          - Pay more to do more work? It's been hard to convince people to do this.
          - Most of members are the "starving hacker" membership, full membership has been flat
          - Dmitry's ideas: one membership tier
                - One membership level, around $40 - would break even overall
                - Automatically get voting after a grace period
                - Then have add on benefits for additional money
                - Have some free benefits to board members
                - Could go to Stripe instead of Paypal (may be a lot of work still)
                - May increase leadership pool, de-stigmatize board membership
                - Two-tier membership model was somewhat of an arbitrary decision at the beginning anyway
                - If everyone is a voting member - we may have problems with Quorum? Shouldn't be an issue - only 10 people needed for quorum
                - Price bump may cause people to drop off
          - Should we put out some feelers to membership? Dmitry will write one up and send to membership
    - Board meeting frequency: proposed 1 per month, 2 per month for next couple weeks

Switching from PNC to Chase
     - Maybe a credit union?
     - Perk of Chase: Zelle
     - First Northern Federal Credit Union
     
Lost flammables cabinet box - FedEx delivered to wrong location

Board Digital Infrastructure
     - ZenDesk will be discontinued July 2018
     - Paid product called "Support" that would have more features - we would get a discount
     - Geared towards customer support - a lot of stuff we don't need, but would do everything we need it to
     - Per person pricing - $3-$5 per person
     - Ride out these last 6 months, then get this software in ~May
 
 Cleaning up GitHub and Google Drive
     - Only financial records and meeting notes 
     - Move stuff to Wiki?
     - Should look to clean up Google Drive at some point as well.
     
 Clean up database
 
 Potpouri
     - Attorney General asked about $100 check - Dmitry will check about whether we actually need to pay it.
