   - Membership termination rules - no update, haven't had time to address (see previous week's notes)
   - Idea: role termination updates and membership tier updates into one rollout
   - Retain mechanism that allows Board to tell Member that they have certain number of days to fix identified problem or have membership terminated
   
- One Membership Tier Proposal - Survey results
   - Only 3 people would quit
    - 1 was going to quit in February anyways
    - 1 was a $10 member
   - We had 3 that agreed to continue donating (Mason, Agocs)
   - Raffle was not that popular
   - Was popular to offer discounts to members, but less so to offer discounts to board members (perverse incentives)
   - A couple of members are geographically not around, but still come every now and then - may consider snowbird memberships for members that don't use the space very often, get a lower rate
    - Will be some requirement that they be a full member for 3 or 6 months
    - Stripe may make this possible - $30 per month, your key scans 12 times a year
    - Stripe works on "invoicing" with discounts and fees that can be applicable (would need to learn code)
   - Comment from survey: don't want to not include the poorer members with the higher membership price.  
    - However, don't know how many members actually fall into this category - seems like most folks are just getting a good deal.
    - Hack Scholars could address this somewhat
    - We could work with folks who legitimate claims (i.e. sweep once a week and we'll knock $10 off your dues)
    - But then we run into the problem of people being embarrased to disclose their incomes to us 
    - New system makes all people full members so they may be more engaged
 - Will "low-key" look at testing out stripe
         
 - Potpouri
    - Do we want to make a donation to charity annually?
    - Do we want to buy an AED (automatic electronic difribulator)? Ballpark $1,500. Replace pads every 2 years
    - We could pay for safety training (CPR, etc) or have people come in to do trainings at the space
    - Start a budget for guest speakers?
