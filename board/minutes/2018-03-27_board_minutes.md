Roll Call: Andrew, Dmitriy, Jeff

Bylaws/Procedural Update
  - "Rules" are being reviewed - may be added to onboarding
  
Onboarding
  - We should formalize the "come back a second time" policy
  - Certification process to be standardized - work on this later, perhaps after we clean up the back room some (making it easy to ID and tag things)
  - Consider having a "onboarding shortlist" for Board members to follow, to make sure the prospective member understands:
    - The culture of the space and how it fits their needs
    - Paying for membership (first month at sign up, PayPal)
    - Getting certified on tools, being responsible for tool use
