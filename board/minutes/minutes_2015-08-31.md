Minutes for 2015-08-31
======================

Roll Call
---------

Dmitriy V, Andrew E, Mason D, Chris S

Money Update
------------

Quoting the absent Agocs:
- At this time last month, we had: 375.35
- Now, we have: 1474.75
- This is including the $1000 we got from Mana and the $1224 we paid to Bubbly, which means we had a sweet $99.40 profit this month.
- $1335.40 was our membership driven income over the past 31 days.

A possibility: Agocs could contact the 4 members and float the following three options:
- Get their money back from the security deposit money
- Pay Budka with the security deposit, reimburse them afterwards
- Get a tax deductible receipt for their donation

Apprenticeship Update
---------------------

Broad strokes:
- Ryan is intending to sponsor 3-4 starving hackers for ~6mo
- Dmitriy will follow up to see what all needs to happen
- Some kind of selection process needs to be developed
- Will mean Cool Folks and Cold Hard Cash entering the space

IRS, Lawyers
------------
- Lawyer Dan got back to Dmitriy post-visit.
- He's going to help us with the Bylaws Question PS:1 encountered and an assessment of our tax liability, things to keep our exempt status valid
- Mason needs to find:
  - Letter from Secretary of State's office that came with our Articles of Incorporation, called Certificate of Incorporation
  - Minutes for a meeting at which something was formally decided
- Dmitriy will follow up with Dan to clarify what kind of meeting that needs to be, provide docs, ask other questions, etc.

Buildout
--------

- Having money would really make this easier
- Lots of weirdly unlabeled breakers

Board Game Night
----------------
- October something-ish
