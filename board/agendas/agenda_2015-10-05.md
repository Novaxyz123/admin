Board Meeting 2015-10-05
=======

Agenda
------

- Ryan's Hack Scholars need advertising, still.
- Does the Treasurer think we are ready to chat with the CPA yet?
- email address changes happened. sweet.
- Mouse traps still clean.
- Nominations are now one week in. Let's go over current nominations. We need to ensure we have enough full members voting. Also need to figure out if PR is coming back to the Board.
- Electrical buildout
  - Shawn did stuff but ran out of fittings. He will be back next weekend.
  - In the meanwhile (or probably at the same time), we can try to insulate and drywall the dividing wall. Shawn says it won't impede his work.
- Buildout in general - it would be helpful to just, I don't know, start sorting the pile of crap we have into smaller organized piles in preparation for moving things back into place.
- Projector
  - Ryan's stuff is in the mail
  - to be installed in the wall whenever it makes it to the space.
  - Turns out the HDMI port on the projector is a little weak and doesn't like having things hanging off it (like the Chromecast). There is a sweet spot where the signal works to which we will have to secure the future downlead HDMI cable.
  - Tim has white paints for us to whitewash the projecting wall.
- Events coming up.
